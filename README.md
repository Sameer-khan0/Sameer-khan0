Hey there! I'm Sameer Khan
Software developer by day, digital alchemist by night ‍♂️ I love building beautiful and functional things on the web, from pixel-perfect UIs to robust back-end solutions.

** Currently obsessed with:**

AI and machine learning (especially their applications in web development)
⚡️ Next.js and the JAMstack for blazing-fast web experiences
Figma and Sketch for crafting stunning UIs and prototypes ️
️ Looking to collaborate on:

Open-source projects that push the boundaries of web development
Creative side projects that solve real-world problems
Anything that involves building amazing things with talented people!

⚡ Fun fact: I can solve a Rubik's cube in under 30 seconds!

Full-stack development (JavaScript, Python, Node.js)

Website accessibility and performance optimization
Always learning new technologies and frameworks!
